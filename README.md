# 5GPacketParser

**5GPacketParser** is an open-source Python tool for parsing NGAP and NAS protocol packets from 5G network traffic and extracting meaningful features from pcap files. This tool is designed for applications in network analysis, performance monitoring, anomaly detection, and research in 5G communication systems.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Parsing**: Handles NGAP and NAS protocol layers encapsulated in SCTP and IP packets.
- **Feature Extraction**: Captures features such as IP addresses, ports, timestamps, and protocol-specific metrics.
- **5G Traffic Insights**: Focuses on 5G-specific protocols, enabling precise analysis of 5G network behavior.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Offers flexibility in filtering packets and customizing output formats.

## Use Cases
- **Network Performance Monitoring**: Analyze flow behavior to optimize 5G network performance.
- **Security Analysis**: Extract features for use in intrusion detection or anomaly detection systems.
- **Research Applications**: Study traffic characteristics for academic or commercial research.

## Prerequisites
Before using **5GFlowParser**, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `scapy` (for packet parsing)
- `pycrate` (for NGAP and NAS encoders and decoders)
- Additional libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trungpv92/5GPacketParser.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd 5GPacketParser
```

## Usage
1. Place your pcap file(s) in the ```pcaps/``` directory.
2. Execute the tool with:
```bash
python 5G_packet_parser.py --input pcaps/example.pcap --output output/features.csv
```
3. Command-line options:
  - --input: Path to the input pcap file.
  - --output: Path to save extracted features.
